# C++-Weather-Predictor
Welcome to my Newbie Programming Class ðŸ˜‰. This is from my first year of learning programming. This is just here to know how much I have improved.

# Does it really predict ?
No it doesn't ðŸ˜œ. It just fetches the data from multiple files of different years and months and just takes average of previous tempratures if you want to predict.

# Improvement
This is here to keep me realizing how much I have improved in last couple of years.
